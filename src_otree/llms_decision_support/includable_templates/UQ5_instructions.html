<h3>
    Part 1: Disruptions
</h3>

<p>
    The supply chain is prone to <strong>disruptions</strong> as some suppliers and roasteries may default. 
    Disruptions may occur between the time you activate suppliers and roasteries, 
    and the actual roasting and shipping of coffee through the network.
    This means if a supplier or a roastery defaults, you still pay for their fixed cost, 
    but cannot use them to supply or roast coffee. 
    Customers are never disrupted.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>probability of disruption</strong> for each entity is displayed within the network.
    This probability allows you to estimate how likely a supplier or roastery will default.
    For example, a 10% chance of a supplier defaulting means, on average, 
    this supplier will default 1 out of 10 times.
    Disruptions across different entities are independent of each other.
    Entities without a specified probability of disruption cannot default.
</p>
<p>
    After you submit your activation decisions, one specific disruption scenario is <strong>drawn randomly</strong> 
    based on the <strong>disruption probabilities</strong>, and your profit is determined accordingly.
