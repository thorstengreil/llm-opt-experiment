            <p>
                The information below provides a summary of the research.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Purpose</h5>
            <p>
                This study aims to investigate how people make decisions in a supply chain environment that may experience disruptions.
                You will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
                Each group is using a different type of interface to make decisions.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Study Procedures</h5>
            <p>
                First, you will read a set instructions and answer questions to confirm your understanding.
                During the experiment itself, you will then make decisions in an exemplary supply chain setting.
                The study will take approximately 60 minutes to complete. 
            </p>

            <h5>Payment</h5>
            <p>
                Your payoff will range between {{ CURRENCY }} {{ BASE_PAYOFF }} and {{ CURRENCY }} {{ TOTAL_MAX_PAYOFF }}, 
                depending on your decisions in the experiment and an element of chance.
                Due to organizational policies, you will be paid via electronic gift certificate.
                You should receive an email about this within five business days.
            </p>

            <h5>Eligibility</h5>
            <p>
                You must be at least 18 years of age to participate.
                You should be a student of business administration, supply chain management, or related fields
                at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
            </p>

            <h5>Declining to Answer and Right of Withdrawal</h5>
            <p>
                Your participation in this research is voluntary.
                You may decline to answer any or all questions and you can withdraw at any time without any adverse consequences.
            </p>

            <h5>Data Protection</h5>
            <p>
                Data collected is anonymized, and no personal identifiers will be stored as part of the research data.
                Personal information required for payment will be stored separately and used only for processing payments.
                Please refrain from discussing the study with others to ensure future participants remain unbiased.

            <h5>Information</h5>
            <p>
                Dear Participant,
            </p>
            <p>
                We would like to ask if you are interested in participating in a scientific study.
                This document contains all essential information about the study.
                A total of 200 participants will be included across two institutions.
                Our institution will enroll 110 participants.
                The study was designed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is being conducted in cooperation with the Technical University of Munich.
                Our institution is funding the study independently.
                The study has been reviewed by an independent ethics committee.
                No objections were raised against its execution.
                Participation in this study is voluntary.
                You may withdraw at any time without providing a reason, and doing so will not result in any disadvantages for you.
                Please read this information carefully.
                The study director will answer any questions you may have.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Why is this study being conducted?</h5>
            <p>
                We aim to investigate how people make decisions in the context of supply chains.
                This includes decisions regarding the selection of suppliers and production locations.
                The decisions are monetarily incentivized, meaning that your payoff will vary depending on your decisions and an element of chance. 
            </p>

            <h5>What is the study procedure?</h5>
            <p>
                You will complete a one-time, two-part experiment on a computer, lasting approximately 45 minutes.
                Both parts require you to make decisions under uncertainty, meaning that your outcome for each part is subject to a predefined random influence.
                Afterward, you will answer some questions about your decisions.
            </p>

            <h5>Is there a personal benefit to participating in the study?</h5>
            <p>
                Besides monetary compensation, participation may help you develop a better understanding of similar decision-making problems, which could be beneficial for your professional life.
                However, no benefits are guaranteed and depend on factors such as your engagement with the study.
            </p>

            <h5>What risks are associated with participating in the study?</h5>
            <p>
                Apart from data protection risks, there are no risks associated with participation.
                More details can be found under "Information on Data Protection."
            </p>

            <h5>Is there financial compensation?</h5>
            <p>
                This information will be repeated in the experiment.
                You will receive a cash amount as compensation whose value is determined by three components:
                You will receive {{ CURRENCY }} {{ BASE_PAYOFF }} as base payoff for attending in person.
                Before the decision-making phase, you will be required to review some information and demonstrate your understanding by correctly answering questions.
                You can earn up to {{ CURRENCY }} {{ MAX_UQ_BONUS }} in additional compensation if you answer correctly on the first attempt.
                The third component depends on your decisions and an element of chance.
                The maximum possible total compensation is {{ CURRENCY }} {{ TOTAL_MAX_PAYOFF }}.
            </p>

            <h5>Can I withdraw or be excluded from the study?</h5>
            <p>
                Participation in this study is voluntary, and consent may be withdrawn at any time.
                You can request the deletion of your generated data immediately after the experiment (see section “Information on Data Protection” for further details).
                In both cases, you will not receive any compensation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you fail to answer a set of introductory questions correctly within two attempts, the experiment will end for you.
                In that case, you will receive the {{ CURRENCY }} {{ BASE_PAYOFF }} base payoff plus any previously earned bonus payments
                ({{ CURRENCY }} {{ UQ_BONUS_PER_PAGE }} per correctly answered set, with {{ NR_OF_UQ_PAGES }} sets in total).
                This mechanism is necessary to ensure that all participants have a uniform understanding of the problem.
                You may also be excluded from the study for organizational reasons.
            </p>

                The Chair of Production and Supply Chain Management at the Technical University of Munich (scm@wi.tum.de) is responsible
                for data processing in this study.
                The legal basis for processing your data is your personal consent (Art. 6(1)(a), Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR).
                Your data will be treated confidentially at all times.
                The data will be collected exclusively for this study and used only within its scope.
                The data also includes personally identifiable information such as age (in years) and gender.
                Any data that could directly identify you (e.g., your name or birthdate) will be deleted or altered in a way that ensures that nobody,
                including the study investigators, can trace the data back to you (anonymization).
                The data will be stored at the Technical University of Munich and deleted 10 years after the study ends.
                We will not share the collected data with any other institution in Germany, the EU, non-EU countries, or international organizations.
                Your consent for data processing is voluntary.
                You may withdraw your consent at any time without providing a reason and without any disadvantages.
                After withdrawal, no further data will be collected.
                However, the legality of data processing that occurred before withdrawal remains unaffected.
                You have the right to request information about your data, including a free copy of your records.
                You may also request correction or deletion of your data.
                However, once data has been anonymized, it can no longer be assigned to you and therefore cannot be accessed, corrected, or deleted.
