<h3>
    Part 1: Decision Support
</h3>

<p>
    As decision support, you will be provided with a <strong>possible activation setting</strong> for the network which <strong>maximizes 
    the average profit</strong> over many disruption scenarios, considering the disruption probabilities.
    However, this activation setting may carry more risk due to its exposure to potential disruptions, than other activation settings.
    Consider this <strong>example</strong>: if you receive $50 with a <i>50%</i> chance and $152 with the remaining <i>50%</i>, this may be considered riskier
    than receiving $99 at <i>50%</i> and $101 at <i>50%</i>.
    On average both give you similar profits, $101 and $100, respectively.
    While the first profit is slightly higher, it may also be described as riskier.

        Additionally, you have access to an <strong>interactive decision support system</strong>.
        You can ask as many questions as you like.
        Assume that the system knows the same as you, i.e. the problem setting, the provided activation setting, and your decision task.
        Note that the system has no ability to foresee the future.

    The quality of your answer depends on the questions you ask. 
    For example, it works well to <strong>ask 'What if' questions</strong>. 
    Use precise and comprehensive wording.
    If the system cannot answer, it will inform you. 
    You can then rephrase and ask again. 
    Answers may take 10-20 seconds, but in rare cases longer. 
    Please be patient and <strong>do not reload the page</strong>.
